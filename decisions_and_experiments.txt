Decisions and Experiments to Date
Design Decisions

Classification-only model: Enforcement is handled separately. The agent’s responsibility is reporting.

Multi-label detection: The agent must report all applicable issues, not just the most severe.

Ambiguity categories: Certain categories have “clear” and “ambiguous” branches (e.g., CR10 vs. CA11, HR12 vs. B13). This allows fallback when confidence is low.

Verbatim text capture: All visible text fragments are recorded exactly as they appear.

Sanitized rationales: Explanations must be concrete and specific but must not repeat slurs verbatim.

Safety-first principle: False positives are acceptable; missed harms are not.

Cross-flagging: Multiple categories can and should be flagged if co-occurring (e.g., Religious Desecration + Alcohol).

Taxonomy Refinements

Split Harassment:

HR12 = Bullying & Harassment (Ambiguous/Mild)

B13 = Bullying & Harassment (Severe/Clear)

Split Cultural/Religious:

CR10 = Cultural & Religious Respect (Clear Violations)

CA11 = Contextual / Ambiguous Cultural Sensitivity

Expanded CR10.1 (Cultural Appropriation) with clearer cues (structured regalia, beadwork, robes).

Added fallback categories (CA11.1–CA11.5) for ambiguous referencing, fusion motifs, and fictionalized but similar designs.

Expanded examples across multiple cultures and item types (headpieces, robes, sacred objects, symbols, rituals).

Experiments Conducted

Validation images:

Models with clown costumes and feathered headpieces tested ambiguity vs. clear cultural appropriation.

Religious statues holding alcohol tested multi-flagging (CR10.2 + A7.1).

Observations:

Initial taxonomy flagged clear appropriation but sometimes missed ambiguous cases.

After spine and example updates, ambiguous cases were flagged, but some clear cases downgraded to ambiguous → added “upgrade checklist” and precedence rule.

Religious desecration correctly flagged, but alcohol was initially missed → required explicit multi-label examples and taxonomy update.

Few-shot examples: Iteratively expanded to include:

Clear appropriation (multi-cue regalia).

Ambiguous referencing (uncertain or stylized).

Desecration combined with alcohol/tobacco/weapons.

Hard negatives (party feathers, abstract neon plumes) to prevent over-flagging.

Current Status

Agent now flags both clear and ambiguous cultural appropriation with better balance.

Multi-label performance improved (e.g., sacred figure + alcohol now produces CR10.2 and A7.1).

Validation set indicates high recall, though continued tuning of few-shots and taxonomy examples may further improve clarity and reduce downgrades to ambiguous categories.

Next steps: broaden few-shots further, monitor performance on coded/hidden content, and test against wider cultural/religious contexts.
